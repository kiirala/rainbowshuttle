Rainbow Shuttle
===============

Fast-paced racing game with shuttles.
Implemented on Kajak3D framework, works at least on Android.

Nothing much here yet...

Compiling
=========
Instructions here are for Android target, I haven't had the time to
try out other possible targets.

* Install android sdk and ndk if you don't have them already
* Get Kajak3D package and extract it to somewhere.
* Edit KAJAK3D_ROOT in jni/Android.mk so that it points to where you
  extracted Kajak3D
* Compile the C++ portion
  $ ndk-build
* Compile Java parts and link
  $ ant debug
* Install to device, overwriting old version if one exists
  $ adb install -r bin/RainbowShuttleActivity-debug.apk
